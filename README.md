[GitHub](https://github.com/EelcoHoogendoorn/BridgeBuilder))

A BridgeBuilder clone written in BlitzBasic. 

UI, graphics and gameplay by Paul Fuller, physics simulation by Eelco Hoogendoorn

The physics simulation is nothing fancy by any standard; it is a simple forward euler integrator mass spring system. 
That being said, independently reinventing these things when 15 years old still stands as one of my most proud accomlishments to date. (fun fact; the first version of the simulation code was implemented using pure trigonometry since id never heard of vectors or how to normalize them)

## Usage
In order to run the code, a [BlitzPlus](https://github.com/blitz-research/blitzplus_msvc2017) runtime is required.
