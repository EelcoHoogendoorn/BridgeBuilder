<H2>Introduction</H2>
<P>
Bridge Builder is a program that allows you to build structures and then test them to destruction for fun and
enlightenment.&nbsp; There are a number of pre-set challenges and a free-form construction mode in which you can build whatever you wish
to within the limits of our materials and your imagination.</P>

</TABLE>
<P>
(Note: Load/Save invoke a dialog but still allow a shortcut ‘n’ to file slots 0-9)</P>

<H2>Edit Mode</H2>
<P>
Edit mode allows you to create your structure by selecting materials, positioning <U>Segments</U> that
are connected at <U>Bolts</U> and using a variety of tools and macros.&nbsp;
This is also where you may Save your structure to disk or Load previously
saved structures.</P>
<P>
There are a number elements displayed in Edit mode</P>


<H3>Display</H3>
<P>The display shows the landscape of the Bridge Builder world.  In Edit mode there is a grid and toolbox - both
of which can be turned on or off.  The Toolbox can be re-positioned by dragging it by the title bar.</P>

<H3>Zooming the Display</H3>
<P>The display can zoom in and out to show either the big picture or more detail for fine work.  The Grid will show at
various levels right down to the smallest construction unit.</P>

<H2>Tool Icons</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Select	Click to select a single Bolt or Segment.  Click and drag to select using a rectangular marquee.
Drag box Left to select segments with either Bolt in rectangle (Green marquee).  Drag box Right to select only
Segments with both Bolts in the rectanlge (Red marquee).  Hold down [Ctrl] and make further selections to extend selection.
[Alt]-Select to select a group of Segments placed by a single Copy/Move/Stretch or macro operation.
<LI>Copy
<LI>Move
<LI>Stretch
<LI>Build	Build a single segment.  Click on the starting point and drag to build a segment in the current primary material.
Attaches to nearby bolt if one exists.  As you move the endpoint, the line will be Green if you can validly place
the endpoint there or Red if you cannot.  Reasons for why you cannot place an endpoint
- It would make the Segment longer than is allowed for that material.
- The endpoint would be placed in an exclusion region
<LI>Build Multiple	Build a segment and start a new one until cancelled (Esc or other selection)
<LI>Group
<LI>Replace
<LI>Line	Build a line of one or more segments to connect two points
<LI>Beam	Build a straight truss structure between the selection points
<LI>Arch	Build a parabolic truss structure within the selection box 
<LI>Circle	Build a circular truss structure with centre and radius according to the selection points

<TD>Steel is a strong and versatile material the introduction of which revolutionised construction from the 18th
Century.  It remains a primary construction material in general use and is often the main load bearing material where
primarily tension or mixed tension/compression forces must be withstood.</TD>

<TD>By combinding the strength in compression of cement (which was known to the ancients) and embedded re-inforcing
rods of mild steel composition to resist tension forces, Concrete achieves an extremely useful balance of properties
and has become one of the most commonly used materials in modern construction.  It is not well suited to primarily
tensile loads and also has a high unit weight making selective placement the key to successful use.</TD>

<TD>Mild steel wires spun into multi-stranded cables revolutionised bridge building in the early 20th Century.  With almost
no strength in compression but with unmatched tensile strength and previously unheard of strength to weight ratios,
Steel Cables liberated designers from the massive structural designs that had previously been necessary.  Steel Cables
find a variety of uses beyond the most obvious application in suspension bridges.</TD>

<TD>Boron Monafilament Cables or more correctly Boron-Boron composite tensile materials became available in the early 21st
Century and heralded the beginning of a new golden age of structural engineering.  While slightly less extraordinary than
Carbon-Carbon composites, Boron Monofilaments have proven to be entirely more practical to manufacture and deploy in real-world
applications.  Their very high cost however means that they are still only used when truly exceptional properties are
called for and no other material will do.</TD>
